# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Meyme AI Voice Agent

This document outlines the product requirements for Meyme, a personality-driven, conversational AI voice agent.

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Vision:** To create a voice-first AI companion that feels less like a tool and more like a character. Meyme is designed to be a cozy, modern, and engaging conversationalist who brings personality and a touch of sass to every interaction.

**Problem:** Most voice assistants are purely functional and lack personality. They are reactive tools, not proactive companions. This project aims to build a voice agent that is not only useful but also entertaining and memorable.

**Goal:** Build a complete, end-to-end, streaming AI voice agent that can engage in real-time, context-aware conversations, perform special skills, and embody a unique, cat-like persona.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Developers & Tech Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in learning about and building with the latest voice AI technologies (STT, LLM, TTS, WebSockets).
- **Hobbyists & Makers:** Users who want a fun, interactive AI to chat with.
- **Participants of the "30 Days of AI Voice Agents" Challenge:** The primary users and builders of this project.

## 3. Core Features (Functional Requirements)

| ID | Feature | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| F-01 | **Real-time Voice Conversation** | The user must be able to speak to the agent and receive a spoken response in near real-time, simulating a natural conversation. | 
| F-02 | **Engaging Persona** | The agent must have a distinct and consistent personality (a sassy, loyal cat named Meyme). All responses should reflect this persona. | 
| F-03 | **Session-based Chat History** | The agent must remember the context of the current conversation. It should be able to refer to previous turns within the same session. | 
| F-04 | **Special Skills (Function Calling)** | The agent must be able to perform tasks beyond simple chat, such as searching the web or executing code, and return the results as part of the conversation. | 
| F-05 | **User-Configurable API Keys** | The user must be able to enter their own API keys for the AI services (AssemblyAI, Gemini, Murf) through the UI, allowing them to run the agent without modifying `.env` files. | 
| F-06 | **Error Handling** | The agent must handle failures in downstream services gracefully, providing a fallback audio message to the user instead of crashing. | 

## 4. Technical Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| T-01 | **Streaming-First Architecture** | The entire pipeline (STT, LLM, TTS) must be built on a streaming model using WebSockets to ensure minimal latency. | 
| T-02 | **Web-Based Client** | The primary interface must be a web application accessible from a modern browser with microphone permissions. | 
| T-03 | **Secure API Key Management** | API keys must be managed securely on the backend and should not be exposed on the client-side. The application should support both `.env` files and user-provided keys. | 
| T-04 | **Modularity & Readability** | The backend code should be well-structured, with services (STT, LLM, TTS) decoupled into their own modules for maintainability. | 

## 5. User Experience (UX) Goals

- **Low Latency:** The time between the user finishing speaking and the agent starting its response should be minimized to feel like a natural conversation.
- **Clear Visual Feedback:** The UI should provide clear indicators for the application's state (e.g., idle, recording, processing, speaking).
- **Simple & Intuitive Interface:** The user interface should be clean and easy to use, with a single, prominent button to initiate conversation.
